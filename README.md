# bot-maintenance

This is a simple telegram bot written in Python.
The only thing it does is replying to private chat with a maintenance notice.

## Quick start
This works on Linux or MacOS:
1. python3 installed on your machine
2. run in shell:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. export your bot token
   ```sh
   export BOT_TOKEN=<insert-the-token-here>
   ```
3. run the bot
   ```sh
   python3 ./bot.py
   ```
